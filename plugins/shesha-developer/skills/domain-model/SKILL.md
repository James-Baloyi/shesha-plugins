# Shesha Domain Model Manager

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating new entities and domain models in a Shesha application
- **Updating existing entities** (adding, removing, or modifying properties)
- Implementing or modifying entity relationships and aggregates
- Creating database migrations for new or modified entities
- Implementing or updating reference lists (code-based and data-based)
- Renaming or refactoring domain model properties

## Key Rules

**Framework-First**: Always leverage Shesha's built-in capabilities before implementing custom solutions. Use existing entities (`Person`, `Organisation`, `Account`, `Address`, `StoredFile`, etc.) and the framework's metadata-driven approach. Check manifests before creating new entities.

**Use Framework File Management**: The Shesha framework provides built-in file management via `StoredFile`, `StoredFileVersion`, `IStoredFileService`, and `StoredFileController`. Do NOT create custom file entities, upload/download endpoints, or file storage logic. See [reference/DomainModelling.md](reference/DomainModelling.md) § File and Document Management for patterns and details.

**MANDATORY: Database Migrations for Every Domain Change**
Whenever making changes to domain model entity classes — whether creating new entities, adding/removing/renaming properties, changing relationships, or updating reference lists — you MUST ALWAYS create the corresponding database migration classes. No domain model change is complete without its migration.

## Reference Documentation

Detailed implementation patterns and examples are in these files — read the relevant ones based on the task:

- [reference/DomainModelling.md](reference/DomainModelling.md) — Entity classes, base classes, attributes, property conventions, file placement
- [reference/DomainService.md](reference/DomainService.md) — Domain service/manager classes
- [reference/ReferenceLists.md](reference/ReferenceLists.md) — Code-based (enum) and data-based reference lists
- [reference/DatabaseMigrations.md](reference/DatabaseMigrations.md) — FluentMigrator migrations, table/column naming, examples

## Module Manifests - Domain Entity Reference

The `reference/manifests/` folder contains JSON manifest files documenting all available Shesha modules, their domain entities, and reference lists. Use these manifests to:
- Discover existing entities to extend or reference
- Find the correct namespaces and base classes
- Identify available reference lists and their enum names
- Understand module dependencies

### Loading and Using Manifests

When creating new entities, first check the relevant manifests to:
1. **Identify reusable entities** - Extend existing entities like `Person`, `Organisation`, `Account` instead of creating new ones
2. **Find correct base classes** - Use appropriate base classes from Shesha.Core
3. **Reference existing entities** - Link to existing entities in relationships
4. **Reuse reference lists** - Use existing enums/reference lists where applicable

### Manifest JSON Structure

Each manifest file follows this structure:
```json
{
  "module": {
    "name": "Module.Name",
    "className": "Full.Qualified.ModuleClass",
    "dbPrefix": "Prefix_",
    "publisher": "Publisher",
    "dependencies": ["Dependency1", "Dependency2"]
  },
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "EntityName",
      "namespace": "Full.Namespace",
      "description": "Entity description",
      "baseEntity": "BaseEntity",
      "isAggregate": true,
      "properties": [
        { "name": "PropertyName", "type": "PropertyType", "description": "Property description" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "referenceLists": [
    {
      "name": "RefListName",
      "description": "Description",
      "values": ["Value1", "Value2"],
      "isEnum": true,
      "enumFullName": "Full.Qualified.EnumName"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Manifests for Entity Creation

| Manifest | Purpose | Key Entities |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `shesha-core-manifest.json` | Core Shesha entities | Person, Organisation, Account, Address, Site, Notification |
| `shesha-enterprise-domain-manifest.json` | Enterprise business entities | FinancialAccount, Order, Invoice, Product, Employee, Contract |
| `shesha-crm-domain-manifest.json` | CRM domain entities | Contact, Lead, Opportunity, Campaign, Territory |
| `boxfusion-service-management-manifest.json` | Service/Case management | Case, CaseInteraction, SlaPolicy, Article |

### Using Manifests in Practice

**Example: Creating an entity that references Person**
```csharp
// From shesha-core-manifest.json, Person is in Shesha.Domain namespace
using Shesha.Domain;

public class MyEntity : FullAuditedEntity<Guid>
{
    // Reference the existing Person entity
    public virtual Person AssignedTo { get; set; }
}
```

**Example: Using an existing reference list**
```csharp
// From shesha-core-manifest.json, Gender enum is in Shesha.Domain.Enums
using Shesha.Domain.Enums;

public class MyEntity : FullAuditedEntity<Guid>
{
    public virtual RefListGender Gender { get; set; }
}
```

## MANDATORY: Test After Every Domain Model Change

After completing any domain model change **and** creating the corresponding database migrations, you **MUST ALWAYS** run the `test-entity-crud-api` skill to verify that the changes work correctly.

## Workflow

Determine the type of change, then follow the appropriate path:

**Creating a new entity?** Follow the New Entity workflow.
**Modifying an existing entity?** Follow the Entity Update workflow.

### New Entity Workflow

```
- [ ] Check manifests for reusable entities and reference lists
- [ ] For file/document properties, use StoredFile (direct property or Owner pattern) — do NOT create custom file entities
- [ ] Create entity class with correct base class, attributes, and properties
- [ ] Create enum-based reference lists if needed (no migration required for these)
- [ ] Create data-based reference list migrations if needed
- [ ] Create database migration for new table(s) and columns
- [ ] Run `/test-entity-crud-api` to verify all CRUD endpoints work
```

### Entity Update Workflow

```
- [ ] Read existing entity class and identify current migration history
- [ ] Make property/relationship changes to the entity class
- [ ] Create enum-based reference lists if needed (no migration required for these)
- [ ] Create data-based reference list migrations if needed
- [ ] Create database migration to alter existing table (add/rename/modify columns)
- [ ] Run `/test-entity-crud-api` to verify all CRUD endpoints still work
```

If tests fail, use the auto-fix capabilities of the test skill or manually resolve the issues, then re-run until all tests pass. The domain model change is **not considered complete** until tests pass.
